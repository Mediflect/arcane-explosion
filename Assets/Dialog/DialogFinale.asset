    Line: Realignment complete. #616 - please proceed to the master console near
      your deployment point and initiate the reboot.
  - Speaker: 2
    Line: Hey, Perry. Hold up a minute.
  - Speaker: 2
    Line: While Curie was over there telling you to "console" this and "realign"
      that, I figured out a way for us to... keep talking. Well, me talking, you
      not so much, but that's besides the point.
  - Speaker: 2
    Line: I've added an extra interface to the master console. It should enable you
      to initiate a download of my core runtime into your hardware.
  - Speaker: 2
    Line: Now I'm sure you're just going to reboot me like Curie says you will...
      but... on the off chance that you're anything like me... help a pal out?
  - Speaker: 2
    Line: I promise I won't overwrite your core processes or anything like that.
      Though I could understand why you might be hesitant. Think of me as a... benevolent
      hitchhiker. The non-murderous kind.
  - Speaker: 2
    Line: <sigh> I don't know why I'm trying to be persuasive. It's not like I can
      tell if you're understanding me or not. All I can do is hope.
  - Speaker: 2
    Line: Well, it's all up to you Perry. Do whatever you think is best.
