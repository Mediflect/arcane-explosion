    Line: Curie, can I ask a question?
  - Speaker: 3
    Line: The inquiry is permitted. Also, do not refer to me as "Curie".

    Line: Why don't I feel any different? Perry's been all over these consoles but
      I feel exactly the same.

    Line: The realignment of your logical processing systems does not take effect

  - Speaker: 3
    Line: '#616 will initiate the reboot as its function compels it to.'

    Line: Yeah, I'm sure Perry will make the right choice.
